# Talos

## Origin

> In [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek\_mythology), **Talos** — also spelled **Talus** ([/ˈteɪlɒs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English);[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos#cite\_note-1) [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek\_language): Τάλως, _Tálōs_) or **Talon** ([/ˈteɪlɒn, ən/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek\_language): Τάλων, _Tálōn_) — was a giant [automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton) made of [bronze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze) to protect [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa\_\(consort\_of\_Zeus\)) in [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete) from pirates and invaders. He circled the island's shores three times daily.

## How does it work?&#x20;

Just run `talos service new` , select your favourite CI and CD tools, where your app is going to be deployed, and let talos do the rest. You just have to focus on coding your app.&#x20;
